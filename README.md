I am trying out Django for the first time for my Market Entry software update and this is the test enviornment I am practicing with.
I created different HTML templates and views for each. I created database models to store information and displayed it in lists. I also used Django forms to create pages for these listed items. I followed a couple of YouTube tutorials, and this was the result.
